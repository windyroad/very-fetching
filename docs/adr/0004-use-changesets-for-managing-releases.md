# 4. Use changesets for managing releases

## Context and Problem Statement

In this monorepo, how do we manage releases

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove it. -->
## Decision Drivers

* The release process should be automated and support Continuous Delivery pipelines

## Considered Options

* [semantic-release-monorepo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release-monorepo)
* [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Changesets", because

* semantic-release-monorepo doesn't correctly detecting need to release new package
* semantic-release forces the release process (commit messages, format, etc contributors
