# 5. use turbo-repo for pipelines

## Context and Problem Statement

Pipelines need to be defined for CI/CD

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove it. -->
## Decision Drivers

* <acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym>
* Ease of testing

## Considered Options

* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
* [turbo-repo pipelines](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/running-tasks)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "turbo-repo pipelines", because

* easy to test locally
* turbo optimises the task execution order
  
### Consequences

* It doesn't allow scaling across multiple jobs. We may need to revisit this decision later.
