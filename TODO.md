# To do

- [x] look into using Changesets instead of semantic-releases
- [x] fix markdown linting
- [ ] fix json linting
- [x] see if changing imports to .ts fixes stale definitions and import not found problem
- [x] see if we can pin the relative package dependencies
- [ ] output jsdoc
- [x] get templated fragment links working
