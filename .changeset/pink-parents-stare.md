Created `@windyroad/link-header`, a browser compatible Typescript fork of [HTTP Link Header], to allow
`@windyroad/fetch-link` and `@windyroad/fetch-fragment` to be used in browsers.

A huge shout-out to the team behind the [HTTP Link Header]. The comprehensive implementation and set
of tests, made porting it to Typescript a breeze.
